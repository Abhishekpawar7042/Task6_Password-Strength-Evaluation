# Task6_Password-Strength-Evaluation

#Objective:
To understand what makes a password strong.

#Tool Used
https://passwordmeter.com

#Passwords Tested:
| Password | Strength 
1.abhishek  | Very Weak
2.abhi123  | Weak
3.Abhi123  | Good
4.Abhishek12 | Strong
5.@Bhi6080$  | Very Strong

#Observations:
- Length and symbol variety improve strength.
- Avoid using common patterns like names or years.

#Best Practices:
- Use 12+ characters.
- Include upper, lower, numbers, and symbols.
- Use passphrases for easy memory.
- Avoid reuse of passwords.

#Common Attacks:
1.Brute force Attack: A brute-force attack is when an attacker tries every possible password (or key) until the correct one is found. No clever guessing â€” just systematic trial of the whole search space.
2.Dictionary Attack: A dictionary attack is a password-guessing technique that uses a precompiled list of likely passwords (common words, leaked credentials, names, and typical variants) to attempt logins or crack password hashes. It is faster than brute-force because it focuses on probable choices rather than all possible combinations. Defenses include using long, random passphrases, enabling multi-factor authentication, blocking common passwords at signup, and hashing passwords securely with salts.
3.Phishing: Phishing is a social-engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities (via email, SMS, or calls) to trick users into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. Common indicators include mismatched sender addresses, urgent requests, suspicious links, and unexpected attachments. Defenses include user awareness training, multi-factor authentication, email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), secure email gateways, and quick incident response procedures.
